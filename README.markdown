Empty 'em
=========

This is a simple Thunderbird extension that empties all _Junk_ and _Trash_ folders. The extension provides a menu item (`Tools` -> `Empty Junk & Trash`) and a toolbar button to do so.

Background
----------

In Thunderbird, I usually have around half-a-dozen email accounts set up. Most of them [Gmail](http://gmail.com) accounts. Very often, Gmail's Junk filter catches tons of Junk email and populates the _Junk_ folders in Thunderbird. After manually cleaning up the _Inbox_ folders and deleting unwanted email, the _Trash_ folders are also populated.

Manually going through all the _Junk_ and _Trash_ folders to empty them, is tedious.

That is what prompted me to write this extension. I hope someone out there finds it helpful too.
