The extension provides a menu item (`Tools` -> `Empty Junk & Trash`), a folder pane context menu item, and a toolbar button to do so.\r\n\r\nAdd-on preferences allow you to include/exclude Junk, Trash, none or both folders in emptying process. You can also choose to override delete confirmation for each folders.\r\n\r\nTo enable debugging, you can enable verbose console messages via preferences.\r\n\r\n### Background\r\nIn Thunderbird, I usually have around half-a-dozen email accounts set up. Most of them Gmail accounts. Very often, Gmail's Junk filter catches tons of Junk email and populates the Junk folders in Thunderbird. After manually cleaning up the Inbox folders and deleting unwanted email, the Trash folders are also populated.\r\n\r\nManually going through all the Junk and Trash folders to empty them, is tedious.\r\n\r\nThat is what prompted me to write this extension. I hope someone out there finds it helpful too.\r\n\r\n### Download\r\n* Empty 'em can be obtained from [Add-ons for Thunderbird website](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/empty-em/)\r\n* Feel free to fork this repository.
